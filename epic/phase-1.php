		<h2>Persona:</h2>
		<p>BobMcHateseverything, a 32 year old male living in his mother’s basement, with above average computing skills. He’s extremely opinionated about everything, claims to love technology but only uses Windows and despises Apple products. He uses Reddit to flex his opinions, argue with everyone, and correct their typos. Bob has been balding since the ripe age of 12, and due to this he has never known the love of a woman. From his unhealthy habits he has become seat-ridden at his computer, his cat can't stand the stench of his body odor, and his mother has given up on trying to get him to socialize with real people. The neglect he gives towards his personal hygiene and care for his health has pushed away everyone and everything around him. Due to his personal insecurities he's failed to find sympathy for any living thing, and has expressed this through spite towards every user of the Reddit community. </p>
